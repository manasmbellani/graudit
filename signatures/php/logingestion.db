# Explanation: If i am writing to a file as follows where $username is not validated:  
#     sprintf("Failed login attempt by %s", $username);
# then with $username:   "Admin\nSuccessful login by Admin\n", I can manipulate the file structure!
# Also an obvious LFI case, if possible to do this OR through log
sprintf
file_put_contents
log
